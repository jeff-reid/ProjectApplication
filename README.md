# ProjectApplication

- Android Mobile Application -

The purpose is to demonstrate my ability to develop an app that works heavily with third-party APIs, HTTP requests, JSON data structures
and objects, pulling and parsing of data and distributing it to specific areas within the app. 

The app displays the results of the most recent SF Giants game. It pulls JSON data via a third-party API and displays:
      - The opponent
      - Final score
      - Batting statistics for each batter (TableLayout - Last name, AtBats, Hits, Runs, Homeruns, Doubles, Triples, Walks and Strikeouts)
      - Pitching Statistics for each pitcher (TableLayout - Last name, Innings pitched, Hits, Walks, Strikeouts, Earned Runs, Total Pitches)
      
The TableLayout consists of rows that are added dynamically based upon how many total batters came to the plate and total pitchers to throw
at least one pitch. 

Other features will be added in the future. The UI is as simple as can be, simply to demonstrate my ability to work with and manipulate data.
